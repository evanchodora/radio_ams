Python-based amatuer radio messaging system that uses AX.25 tools to allow clients to interact with a remote server for storing, retrieving, and managing messages.
Clients that connect to the server are presented with a CLI to allow them to view recently active users, view/delete messages sent to them, and write messages to others to be stored in the database.
Offers a convenient way to provide an internet-less messaging system for mobile operations and local communications.
